# VFR-App

Veterans and First Responders (VFR) app that finds local establishments that offer discounts. App uses crowd-sourcing to fill the database with the most accurate information available.

## App Functionality

1. User has the ability to Search the data base by city, zip, or by business name to filter out businesses that offer discounts to VFR's.
2. If user visits a place that he/she knows is not included in the database, then they have the ability to add that establishment.
3. All businesses will show on a mini-map in the Search component.
